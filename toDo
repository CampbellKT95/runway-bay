# Last Things Before Re-Deployment

1. Make all tenants email a .env variable & make them the recepients of memo
2. Set up manual scheduler to email Dave 45 days before each tenant's lease expiration

## FINALE

Re-deply backend to heroku and frontend to netlify

# Idea for scheduling emails

    Should probably put in controllers/tenants since I need access to dates already provided

    Should make a seperate, but similar, sendMail() function specifically to be used within scheduleEmail()

    a. Once I have start/end date, can use equation to calculate the number of days between them & subtract 45 to schedule the 45 day reminder
        const oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // hours*minutes*seconds*milliseconds
        const startDate = new Date(2008, 1, 12);
        const endDate = new Date(2008, 1, 22);

        const diffDays = Math.ceil(Math.abs((startDate - endDate) / oneDay));
