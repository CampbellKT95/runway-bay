*Edit icon successfully refills content of form, except for phone: {
    business, cell
    }

*clear() at end of onsubmit does not clear fields with null, since setting it back to null does not clear the field for some reason


should probably add a label to each input field, since repopulation will make it unclear what each input is about



Things to do later on:
    Set up react router ("/" being login, then going to a combo of form & tenants list)

    Set up Auth

    Set up automatically emailing (or text if possible) for when a lease hits 45 days left (and also when rent is due)

**Add an attachment uploader to enable attaching of lease (in same video I have been watching)**
