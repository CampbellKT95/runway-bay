# SET UP SCHEDULER(), EXPORT JUST BELOW SENDMAIL();

    ONCE I HAVE TENANT START DATES, CAN MANUALLY SET UP SCHEDULED EMAIL FOR EACH ONE

Create button should link us back to tenants, but currently does not despite <Link> being in place

Token is now successfully saved, but I have to refresh to see all tenants once I have been pushed to /tenants

Remove all console logs

## FINALE

Re-deply backend to heroku and frontend to netlify
