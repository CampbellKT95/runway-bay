MAILER SUCCESSFUL, WILL NOW NEED TO FECTH DATA FROM /TENANTS TO ENABLE CLIENT TO SEND WHATEVER HE TYPES INTO MEMO

    Will need to bring dispatch into tenants, and dispatch memo to backend.





ALSO HAVE SCHEDULED MAILER SET UP
    ONCE I HAVE TENANT START DATES, CAN MANUALLY SET UP SCHEDULED EMAIL FOR EACH ONE


Create button should link us back to tenants, but currently does not despite <Link> being in place


Token is now successfully saved, but I have to refresh to see all tenants once I have been pushed to /tenants


###################

Remove all console logs

Set up a memo section in /tenants where Dave can push out important updates

## FINALE

Re-deply backend to heroku and frontend to netlify
