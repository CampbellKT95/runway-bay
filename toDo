**issue with security_received. not casting to boolean (ie not successfully being converted to true or false, likely due to typo in value?)



Delete current db entries, add fake data to check that I have full access
    Will need to change around singltenant to remove array access and just focus on objects


Edit input fields to allow for placement in model properly (currently does not accurately accept subfield like phone/cell within contact)
    Maybe need to change state to mirror model?
